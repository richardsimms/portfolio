I'm thrilled to share that our team has just released v0.1 of [Career Compass](http://seek.com.au/career-advice/compass), a product designed to help career changers navigate the maze of opportunities out there.


## Navigating the intricate maze of career possibilities
Changing careers is almost an inevitability in today's dynamic job market. Statistics indicate that the average person will switch careers more than 5 times during their lifetime¹. Meanwhile, a staggering 78% of the workforce reports feeling disengaged with their current roles². Add to that the 40% of jobseekers who are actively contemplating a career switch³, and it's evident we're dealing with a pervasive issue. The challenge? Finding a new career that aligns with one’s unique combination of skills, passions, and goals.

## A compass for your career journey
That’s where Career Compass steps in. Our tool serves as an interactive guide that simplifies the complex process of career discovery. By answering a few career-related questions, users can quickly uncover job roles that resonate with their personal and professional aspirations. These insights aren’t just generic suggestions but tailored pathways drawn from a deep understanding of various industries and roles.

## Personalised career insights for every step of your journey
Career Compass isn't just a one-off solution but a comprehensive platform designed to support you at every phase of your career journey. You start with introspection, identifying your skills, interests, and values. From there, our tool provides actionable advice to guide your first steps towards a new role. This all culminates in helping you muster the confidence to take the final plunge into your next career. By aligning your unique profile with relevant job opportunities, Career Compass increases engagement and satisfaction in your professional life.

## A level playing field with the power of AI
It's worth noting that while there may not be a "perfect" career recommendation, the utilization of large language models like chatGPT has democratized access to high-quality career advice. We're excited about the synergies between our approaches and look forward to the transformational changes we can bring to the world of career transitions.
