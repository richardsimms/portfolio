As product designers, we often grapple with the complex task of making intricate ideas approachable and engaging for our users. Storytelling is a powerful tool in this regard, but how can we elevate it further? My recent journey into the realm of AI and character design led me to an innovative solution: a reusable AI character that can take storytelling in design to the next level.


## MidJourney: The Concept of a Reusable Character
The idea is simple but powerful. Create a consistent, reusable character that can be deployed across various scenarios. This character acts as a recurring element, lending depth and continuity to your story. Itâ€™s akin to having a well-loved protagonist in a novel who readers can follow through various adventures, making the narrative more compelling.

## Storyboarding: Crafting the Narrative
Once the character is developed, the next step is to incorporate them into different scenes. Using ChatGPT, I created a [storyboard](/articles/crafting-customer-stories-with-ai) that animates the character in various situations. This not only makes the character more relatable but also enhances the overall storytelling by providing a visual narrative.

## A Step-by-step Guide to Creating Your Own Reusable Character
1. **Create the Character**: Begin with a design prompt that outlines your vision. For example: ```A detailed three-view, full-body, street style photo of a woman, shot on Kodak Gold 200.```
2. **Upscale the Image**: Locate an image that perfectly encapsulates your vision and upscale it using relevant software.
3. **Capture the Angles**: Screenshot each angle of your upscaled image and paste them back into a Discord message for future reference.
4. **Imagine Prompt for Different Scenes**: Create new prompts to imagine your character in different scenarios. For instance, you could use: ```A woman thoughtfully browsing in a high-end mall store,``` followed by detailed settings and styles to make the scene vivid and expressive.

## Conclusion
The result of this creative process is a reusable character that not only adds depth and continuity to your storytelling but also serves as a versatile tool for conveying complex ideas in an engaging way. In the ever-evolving landscape of design, innovative solutions like this one are not just beneficial; they are essential.
