# Salary Advice
Enabling jobseekers to compare salary trends and make career decisions
We helped jobseekers to make informed career choices, as measured by job ad visits and applications starts. Which contributes in creating the value of over $5 million through acquired visitors to a salary product that displays the latest salary trends by role titles and industries.

### Our approach
Career Advice is where you can explore many careers, read articles, interact with tools like salary calculators, resume templates, and skills tools. Our vision for Career Advice is to become APAC"s leading and most trusted career partner. We achieve this by helping our candidates drive their career forward, and create value by building brand trust and establishing us as a career partner and not just a jobs board. An opportunity to help us achieve our vision was to become the leading site for salary keywords in the APAC region. By using our salary data from job ad posting as a competitive advantage, that helps attract jobseekers to make informed choices and in return creates value for the core business through job applications.

### The result
We uncovered the opportunity to build a salary acquisition product in the final quarter of 2021. We noticed that our organic traffic to our Career pages in Australia was beginning to plateau. Furthermore, we wanted to make sure that we were surfacing the most relevant results that match the user"s query fairly. Our career pages were serving multiple intents from What"s it like to be… How to become… What can I earn as… What are the skills I need… and so on. This bloated page content strategy, confused our users, and these multiple intents were being down-ranked by Google. When we dug into it a bit further, we found that we had mostly been underperforming for salary keywords.

Our competitors; PayScale, talent.com, Glassdoor and LinkedIn, occupied Google"s top search results through dedicated pages specifically for salary by individual roles.

### How we built confidence
We set up an experiment to test a hundred pages for salary intent search traffic. The salary insights used the full-time salary ranges based on job ad data to calculate the typical adverse salary by locations. To reduce risk, we avoided the top 50 career pages and chose a mixture of roles with varying degrees of traffic and ranking on Google, across a range of industries.

After a couple of months, we were seeing some positive results. Particular career pages that had not ranked before were now ranking. Those that were on page two of results, were now on page one and some were appearing as the top result. Because of this, we started to see traffic uptick. This gave us the confidence to roll out salary pages to all our career roles that we had salary data for, starting in Australia. We set a measurement of success target of 36,000 onward journeys from the salary page to the job site and create value through acquired visitors.

### Continuous discovery
We spoke to customers on a weekly basis and gathered their comments through our feedback loops on the page. Our story-based interviews helped us understand how people were using the product and in what context. We organised the opportunities against a business objective and chose the highest impact solutions to design tests that would de-risk our chosen opportunities. We tested many assumptions to validate the solutions. We were able to prove that people required more comparison salary data, through fake door and one question on page surveys. Also disprove that we needed to build complex features such as a tax and super calculator for each career role. We made enhancements like adding hour rate and viewing salary ranges across industries.

We surfaced salary content throughout Career Advice using interactive modules that drive visits to the salary pages. These interactive banners preformed better than their static alternatives in our experiments. Attracting more engagement and allowed visitors to benchmark their salary against the typically advertised salary for that career. This benchmarking tool showed people if they were being paid appropriately for their role, or if a new career direction is worth chasing.

### How it performed
Since the product when live and was scaled up in March 2022 the organic traffic to these pages has just ballooned to over 175,000 organic visits per month and accelerated beyond our competitors. Our targets were for 36,000 onward journeys to jobs from visitors, but we were actually seeing closer to 80,000 a month, and we"re getting around 10,000 Job app starts a month from this traffic. It was great to see that we were helping people understand salary trends and make a career decision to find their next role.

### What happened next?
We know that people make decisions based on their expectations vs the typical salary range. We focussed in on the opportunity to help satisfy the user intent when they compare their salary. To understand how to provide clear next steps based on their comparison. The demand for salary information was aligning with the global economy recession. Which gave us the opportunity to work with the marketing growth team to scale the product through the JobStreet and JobsDB brands into Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.
