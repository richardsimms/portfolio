### Our approach
Working in small teams, we designed the site one section at a time. I lead a visual and UX team across key pages in five intensive two-week sprints. In each sprint, we defined and overcame challenges by interviewing stakeholders; refining ideas and presenting wireframes and flows to the client throughout.

Employing InVisions Craft to keep the teams aligned and storing our component library in Zeplin, we built prototypes of the interactions; from micro-interactions to full page flows. These accompanied annotations and production access of the design ready to be built in Sitecore.
